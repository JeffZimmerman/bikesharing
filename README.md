## Overview
This project utilized Tableau to analyze Citibike data from New York City and generate multiple visualizations. The broader goal was to consider the potential for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  

## Results
Demographic information of Citibike users, including identifiers such as gender or customer/subscriber status, was visualized in line graphs and heatmaps to assess patterns of use. Additional data points such as the starting and ending times of individual trips provided opportunities for insights into the typical duration of trips, as well as visual demonstation of periods of greater bike use at certain times of the day and on certain days of the week. Adding to these factors, latitudinal and longitudinal data was mapped to show the locations with the greatest concentration of bike trips beginning and ending.
