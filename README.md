## Overview
This project utilized Tableau to analyze Citibike data from New York City and generate multiple visualizations. The broader goal was to consider the potential for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  

## Results
Demographic information of Citibike users, including identifiers such as gender or customer/subscriber status, was visualized in line graphs and heatmaps to assess patterns of use. Additional data points such as the starting and ending times of individual trips provided opportunities for insights into the typical duration of trips, as well as visual demonstation of periods of greater bike use at certain times of the day and on certain days of the week. Adding to these factors, latitudinal and longitudinal data was mapped to show the locations with the greatest concentration of bike trips beginning and ending. 


## Summary
A number of clear patterns emerged in creating visualizations out of Citibike data, some of which are relevant to the potential of establishing a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 
- The overwhelming number of trips were short in length. This may owe in part to the density of New York City and short distances between bike access locations. New York users likely also use Citibike as a complement to subway, bus, and commuter train routes. Users in Des Moines may use bikes as the sole transportation option, or opt against bike use if the trip becomes too complicated.
- There were more male users overall, but their use patterns largely matched those of female users and those whose gender was not categorized. This remains consistent when accounting for factors like duration of trip, usage at certain hours of the day, and usage by days of the week.
- Weekday usage was greatest during the morning and evening commutes, while weekend usage was spread out more during the middle of the day. This points to two lessons for creating a new bike-sharing program: bike pickup and dropoff locations should be positioned to facilitate use by commuters, while they should also be located to accomodate access to weekend recreation locations and tourist destinations. 
- Comparing regular bike-sharing subscribers to single-use customers, the visualizations reveal that subscribers tend to utilize bikes throughout the week, on both weekdays and weekends. Short-term customers, by contrast, have greater usage on weekends, suggesting that this category may consist of tourists or light users that take advantage of the bikes mostly for recreation. Bike trips by subscribers account for a greater amount of overall usage, suggesting that those willing to commit to a subscription are able to integrate the bike-sharing network into their lives in a consistent way.
### Future Analysis
Mapping the starting and ending locations of bike trips shows a large concentration in Manhattan, in particular Midtown and Lower Manhattan, with a lower concentration in areas of Brooklyn and Queens close to Manhattan. The complete absence of bike locations elsewhere, outside of a scattering in the Bronx, suggests that existing use patterns match the centers of work and tourism locations in Manhattan. Areas of the other boroughs that are more distant may also have significant usage if made available, to reflect trips not focused on Manhattan as the sole destination.
One demographic data point that did not make it into the visualizations is birth year. Filtering the data by gender did not show significant differences in use patterns for time of day or day of the week. It would be worth examining whether age makes any difference in terms of the timing of bike trips. Additionally, filtering by age in a mapping of bike use might show a greater number of middle-aged users commuting to Midtown for work, and other age groups taking trips more for other purposes.
In considering the feasibility of a bike-sharing program in a smaller city like Des Moines, differences in physical infrastructure might make a big difference. In looking again just at New York, additional visualizations could integrate subway maps and station usage data from the MTA, as well as maps of designated bike routes. The mapping of greater bike-sharing trips in certain areas may owe a lot to these infrastructural allowances, for example the high usage along the west side of lower Manhattan, where a designated bike route follows a long stretch of the Hudson river.
